# This is a guide to help you recap everything

## Files structure

- `src`
  Contains everything related to our project
  - `app`
    Contains the routes/pages of the project
    - `_lib`
      This route is hidden by default (private)
      - `page.tsx`
      This page won't be displayed as a separate route, instead it's just a file
    - `%5Funderscore`
      This is how to have `_` in a route
      - `page.tsx`
    - `about`
      An example of a normal route that has a `page.[t|j]sx` file that exports a react component and it represents a page
      - `page.tsx`
        An example of a route page
    - `profile`
      - `page.tsx`
    - `dashboard`
      - `page.tsx`
      The default export will be the page shown for `/dashboard` endpoint
      - `table.tsx`
        We can have any components in the same page route and they will be hidden from the users and we can still use them inside the pages through using them in a component, it's usefull for related route components to be used on the same page
    - `(auth)`
      Used to have specific styles/configs for this group of routes
      - `forgot-password`
        - `page.tsx`
      - `register`
        - `page.tsx`
      - `login`
        - `page.tsx`
    - `products`
      - `[productid]`
        This is a parameter that matches any value for `productid` in `/products/<productid>` if it's not found as a folder (e.g `/products/special`)
        - `reviews`
          - `page.tsx`
            - `[reviewid]`
              - `page.tsx`
              - `not-found.tsx`
        We can have a special `not-found` page using this file for this specific path - `page.tsx`
      - `special`
      This matches first then `[productid]`
        - `page.tsx`
      - `page.tsx`
    - `blog`
      - `first`
        - `page.tsx`
      - `second`
        - `page.tsx`
      - `page.tsx`
    - `docs`
      - `[[...slug]]`
        This matches `/docs`,`/docs/<path>`, `/docs/<any>/<path>`, `/docs/<any>/<long>/<path>` ..etc - `page.tsx`
  - `layout.tsx`
    To apply a layout to all routes, and it's auto generated by "next" if we don't create one
  - `not-found.tsx`
    We can have a custom `not-found` page using this file and it will be applied to the sub-routes
  - `page.tsx`
    The home page

## Important notes

<!-- ### To enable TailwindCSS
You need to `import './globals.css'` in a `page.tsx` or a `layout.tsx` -->

<!-- ## Files/Folders guide -->

<!-- ### src
This folder contains everything we mainly focus on

Like tsx/jsx files for generating the html and js files for our pages

### layout.tsx
This has common designs and components that all pages share

### page.tsx
This represents a page -->
